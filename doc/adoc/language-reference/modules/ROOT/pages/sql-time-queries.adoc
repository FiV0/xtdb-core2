= SQL Time Queries

https://github.com/xtdb/core2-playground/blob/main/bitemporal/snodgrass-99.sql[Some examples from the `core2-playground` repo].

== Time Columns

* `SYSTEM_TIME`
* `APPLICATION_TIME`

== Time Travel

* `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF`
* `FOR APPLICATION_TIME AS OF`

== Ignoring Time

* `FOR ALL SYSTEM_TIME`
* `FOR ALL APPLICATION_TIME`

== Periods

Intentionally duplicated from Data Types doc:

* `PERIOD(x,y)`

== Temporal Predicates

* `CONTAINS, OVERLAPS, EQUALS, PRECEDES, SUCCEEDS, IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES, and IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDS`

== Automatic (Application) Time Period Splitting

* Probably just mention that this happens on `UPDATE` / `DELETE`?
