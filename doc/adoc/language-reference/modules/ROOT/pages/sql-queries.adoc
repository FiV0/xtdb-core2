= SQL Queries

[#gotchas]
== Gotchas

Before discussing basic queries, it's worth being aware of a few "gotchas" present in XTDB Core2:

* TODO: row types
* TODO: type equality semantics
* TODO: cast / overflow / BigDecimal


[#select]
== Basic SELECT

Assuming the `insert` statement from the
xref:language-reference::sql-transactions.adoc[SQL Transactions] documentation, you will see:

[source,sql]
----
select users.name from users;
----

returns:

[source,text]
----
 name
-------
 "Matt"
(1 row)
----
