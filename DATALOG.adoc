==  Usage - differences to XTDB 1.x

=== Architecture

Where XTDB 1.x has a transaction log, document store and query indices, 2.x has a transaction log and an object store.

* XTDB 1.x transactions are split up into 'tx-events' and documents, with the former going on the tx-log and the latter to the doc-store.
  In 2.x, the transaction log doesn't need to have infinite retention, so we no longer need this split - transactions go straight on to the log, and the document store is obsolete.
* Rather than each node having its own query indices, 2.x shares these between nodes in a cluster via the object store.
  The object store is hence _the_ golden store, thanks to the transience of the transaction log.
* The files stored in the object store are in https://arrow.apache.org/[Apache Arrow] format, the structure of which 2.x takes responsibility for maintaining - we no longer require a KV store.

=== Setup

Main require: `[xtdb.api.datalog :as xt]`

Configuration uses https://github.com/weavejester/integrant[Integrant].

You can still start a completely in-memory node using `(xtdb.node/start-node {})`.
For a Kafka/JDBC node:

[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [node (node/start-node {:xtdb.kafka/log {:bootstrap-servers "localhost:9092"}

                                   :xtdb.jdbc.postgres/dialect {}
                                   :xtdb.jdbc/default-pool {:db-spec {:user "postgres"
                                                                       :password "postgres"
                                                                       :database "core2test"}}
                                   :xtdb.jdbc/object-store {}})]
  ;; ...
  )
----

The CLI parameters, and EDN/JSON configuration file formats are the same as XTDB 1.x.

=== Transactions

Transactions are slightly different to XTDB 1.x:

- `[:xtdb.api/put <doc>]` -> `[:put <doc>]`. Put and delete supported thus far.
- `:xt/id` -> `:id`. Valid ID types currently strings, numbers, dates.
- `tx-time` -> `sys[tem]-time`
- `valid-time` -> `app[lication]-time`

=== Datalog Queries

The Datalog API is in `xtdb.datalog`

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[xtdb.datalog :as xt]])

(with-open [node (node/start-node {})]
  (xt/q node '{:find [e name]
               :where [[e :name name]]}))
----

These queries currently return a vector of maps `[{:e ..., :name ...}, {...}]`, although this is only because it's what was closest to what we had available at the time.

=== SQL queries

Same as Datalog, but use `xtdb.sql` instead.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[xtdb.sql :as xt])

(with-open [node (node/start-node {})]
  (xt/submit-tx node "INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES ('jms', 'James')")
  (xt/q node "SELECT u.name FROM users u"))
----

=== Bases

2.x doesn't have the concept of DBs - instead, we pass the node and (optionally) a 'basis' to queries.
Unlike 1.x, a 2.x client will implicitly await the last transaction it submitted - in normal usage, a user shouldn't need to either `await-tx` (indeed, such a function doesn't publicly exist in 2.x) nor supply an explicit basis.

[source,clojure]
----
;; simple case - will indefinitely await the latest transaction you've submitted:
(xt/q node '{...})

;; specify a transaction basis, and/or a timeout
(xt/q node (-> '{:find ..., :where ...}
               (assoc :basis {:tx tx}
                      :basis-timeout (Duration/ofSeconds 1))))
----

The `q` functions take the node, the query, and then a variable number of params.

[source,clojure]
----
(xt/q node
      '{:find [e]
        :in [first-name last-name]
        :where [[e :first-name first-name]
                [e :last-name last-name]]}
      "Ivan" "Ivanov")
----

`q&` is the same, except it runs entirely asynchronously and returns a `CompletableFuture` of the query plan.
(In fact, `q` just calls `q&` and deref's it.)

The basis map can also contain a `:current-time` option, which applies to any entities that don't specify other app-time constraints.
This is for repeatable queries - it defaults to 'now' if not provided.

[source,clojure]
----
(xt/q node
      (-> '{:find [e name]
            :where [[e :name name]]}
          (assoc :basis {:current-time #inst "..."})))
----
