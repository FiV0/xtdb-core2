= XTDB "Core2" Research

Welcome to the XTDB research repository.

XTDB Core2 is an experimental, SQL-first, immutable database concept.


== Vision

The technical aim is to layer on temporal query capability on top of a immutable, columnar data storage.

Core2 will support the SQL:2011 specification whilst aiming for a schemaless document model,
and will embrace a separate-storage-from-compute architecture.
Core2 uses Apache Arrow as the data-format, and the engine allows for querying across nested document data.

Read more about Core2 in our https://xtdb.com/pdfs/vision-doc.pdf[Vision Document] (PDF).


== SQL:2011

XTDB not only supports the SQL:2011 standard, it makes SQL:2011 accessible.
All data is bitemporal.
Document records remove the need for awkward bitemporal schema migrations.

SQL:2011 queries enable querying _across_ time.
For example, the following query asks "Which employees and contractors worked for the company at the same time?"

[source,sql]
----
SELECT employee.name, contractor.name
FROM employee, contractor
WHERE employee.application_time OVERLAPS contractor.application_time
----


== Warning

This is an experimental project.

If you are looking for an existing immutable document database with bitemporal query, we will continue to develop
and support XTDB 1.x here: https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb

Stable XTDB releases found here: https://docs.xtdb.com/administration/installing/


== Hows does this differ from XTDB 1.x?

XTDB 1.x is a mature product offering, used in production, with on-going development focusing on continued hardening and performance.
XTDB 1.x is a Datalog-first, in-process embeddable database, offering advanced 'peer-like' functionality such as transaction-functions,
speculative transactions, programmatic Datalog rules, and more.

XTDB Core2 has a different goal of bringing immutability, schemaless documents, and temporal query to a mainstream SQL audience.
