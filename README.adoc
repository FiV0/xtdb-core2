= XTDB '`Core2`' Research ðŸ§ª

Welcome to the XTDB research repository!

XTDB '`Core2`' is an experimental, SQL-first, immutable database concept.


== Vision

The technical aim is to implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011#New_features[SQL:2011 temporal query capabilities] on top of immutable, columnar data storage.

Core2 implements a dynamic schema model (i.e. no explicit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language[DDL] is required) and allows for relational querying across nested, document-shaped data.
Core2 embraces a https://xtdb.com/blog/dev-diary-may-22/#_pillar_1_sosac[separated-storage-and-compute] architecture, using https://arrow.apache.org/[Apache Arrow] as the underlying columnar data format.

Read more about Core2 in our https://xtdb.com/pdfs/vision-doc.pdf[Vision Document] (PDF).


== SQL:2011

All data in XTDB is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitemporal_modeling[bitemporal data].
Core2 not only implements SQL:2011's bitemporal features, but makes those features much more practical and accessible to regular users.
Traditional concerns about awkward bitemporal schema migrations are avoided thanks to pervasive support for dynamic querying across polymorphic records.

SQL:2011 queries enable querying _across_ time.
For example, the following query asks "Which employees and contractors worked for the company at the same time?"

[source,sql]
----
SELECT employee.name, contractor.name
FROM employee, contractor
WHERE employee.application_time OVERLAPS contractor.application_time
----


== Warning

This is experimental software.

If you are looking for a stable release of an immutable document database with bitemporal query capabilities, we are continuing to develop and support XTDB 1.x here: https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb


== Hows does this differ from XTDB 1.x?

XTDB 1.x is a mature product offering that is used in production by many organizations, and its ongoing development is focused on hardening and performance.
XTDB 1.x is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog[Datalog-first], embeddable database that emphasizes in-process JVM usage to enable advanced functionality like user-defined transaction functions, speculative transactions, programmatic Datalog rules, and more.

Core2's initial objective is to take the key principles embodied in XTDB 1.x -- immutability, schemaless records, and temporal querying -- to a mainstream SQL audience.
